###yanni4night.com ONLINE

After I spent a whole afternoon and ï¿¥229,<http://yanni4night.com/> is online.

Recently,I am always  disturbed by the so-called `Church of the God's` -- a branch of the Christianity.It's origin is in South Korea.I was even invited to learn its doctrine,I guess it's just another explain of Holy Bible.
Jesus landed in South Korea,so we got father and mother,and even mother is still alive now.How ridiculous.


I even got a cold,what a fucking day.So I decided to refuse all the calls.I guess I should change a phone number.So sorry for _ZhangYu_ and _Chebing_.

I wanted to be a vegetarian,now I am pretty sure I failed.It's so hard to find a meal having no meat.FYI,I like KFC.

Actually I failed much more other things.Cause this site cost my $229,I should hang in here.
